Code Review

1. Code structure & coding conventions

- the package name is too generic; where is the module name?
- the class name says nothing
- the function name is too generic
- the function arguments names say nothing
- t and s must have meaningful names

2. Implementation
- too many "magic numbers" (hard-coded values)
- is t limited to {1, 2, 3, 4} or could it be bigger?
- there are no validations

3. Single responsibility & keep it simple stupid
- outsource intermediary computations into new simple functions

4. reduce the complexity of existing functions - single responsibility & keep it simple and stupid
- reduce repeating patterns
- remove the switch by refactoring the first case

5. single responsibility & dependency inversion
- refactor the custom exceptions
- remove the dependency on validations
- remove the dependency on values and operations managed by marketing
